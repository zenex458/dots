####### pass the names of files eg, sel f1 f2 f3 f4
####### sel will use readlink to put these in a file
####### then use sel -de dir to empty the list and put the files into dir

	##loop thorough the array and compare file1 with fle2, then file3 and so on, then do the same with file 2, this should remove duplicates

##read the absolute file names from parameters eg, sel file1 file3 will be interpreted as $pwd/file1 $pwd/file2
path=$(readlink -f "$@")

###echo this absolute file path to a file
printf "%s \n" "$path" >> list actually inn future put it into an array
rmdup list1 list2 ##remove duplicates of list1 and put the result to list2 
mv list2 list ##clear list (well overwrite list1 as list2)
cat list

sel -d
xargs -a list -I {} cp -iv {} "$PWD" read the file line by line and paste it to the current directory
